	must refer to one of the files here that contains it.
	
	dataFiles.id			The unique ID of the data file.

	DATA DEFINITIONS
	
	This section is used to define any engine-native and custom data definitions. Any
	data object defined in a data XML file must be presented here with it's unique ID.
	Each group tag represents a specific data type and all data definitions for this
	data type must be within such a group. The group tag can have the following
	attributes:
	
	group.type			(Mandatory) The data type that the group represents, The data type
						parser class must be mapped in the Class Registry with this string.
	group.fileID		(Optional) If all data definitions represented in the group are
						part of the same data file, the data file ID can be specified with
						this attribute instead of each entry need to have a data file ID.
	group.id			(Optional) By specifying an ID for the group it becomes a resource
						collection whose data definitions can be loaded with one call
						instead of having to load every single item in the group.
	
	resource.id			The ID of the data definition as specified in it's data file.
	resource.fileID		The ID of the data file in which the item is defined in. If
						group.fileID is set, this attribute can be omitted.
	======================================================================================= -->

		<!-- Data type group for native data type of Settings. -->

	XML FILE DEFINITIONS
	
	Definitions for XML file entries that contain XML data that should not be parsed by
	the engine directly.
	
	resource.id				Unique resource ID for the XML data.
	resource.path			Path of the XML file.
	resource.packageID		ID of the resource package that the XML file is in.

	<!-- ======================================================================================
	TEXT RESOURCE DEFINITIONS
	
	Definitions for multi-locale text resources. A single text resource can consist of
	multiple locale entries, each representing the same text content in a different language.
	If a required locale is not defined for a text resource the engine will fall back on
	using the default (first-defined) locale of the text resource. The following example
	entries define two text resources "textUI" and "textDialogues" which both define a
	default, English locale "en". The locale entries for "de" and "jp" are not defined so
	the engine will use English even if "de" or "jp" are selected as the current locale.
	
	resource.id			The unique resource ID of the text resource.
	locale.lang			The language identifier of the text resource's locale entry.
	locale.path			The file path of the respective locale entry.
	locale.packageID	ID of the resource package that the locale file is in.
	======================================================================================= -->
	<text>
		<resource id="textUI">
			<locale lang="en" path="text/en/ui_text.xml" packageID="resourcePackage"/>

	PRELOAD LIST
	
	List of resources that are being preloaded by the engine. Preloaded resources are being
	loaded during the engine startup phase, even before the first screen is opened. This
	functionality can be used to preload resources that should be available by default or
	as early as possible.
