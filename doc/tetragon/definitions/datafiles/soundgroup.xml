	SOUNDGROUP DEFINITION FILE
	A sound group defines a collection of sound objects that are played in a linear
	or random order.
	===========================================================================================
	soundIDs				A list of all Sound IDs that are part of the sound group.
	loops					(Optional) The number of times the whole sound group should loop.
							0 is one-shot, -1 is endless. Default: 0.
	playMode				(Optional) Playback mode of the sound group. One of the following:
							"forward", "backward", "pingpong", "random" or "triggered". Sounds
							in the group are played according to the order that they are placed
							in the group and the specified play mode.
	pauseMinDuration		(Optional) This property together with pauseMaxDuration can be used
							to determine a pause between sounds played in the group. If both min
							and max are 0, no pause occurs, if both values are different, a
							random value will be calculated between min and max duration.
	pauseMaxDuration		(Optional) This property together with pauseMinDuration can be used
							to determine a pause between sounds played in the group. If both min
							and max are 0, no pause occurs, if both values are different, a
							random value will be calculated between min and max duration.
	allowRandomRepeats		(Optional) If playmode is "random" this value can be set to false
							to prevent a random sound from being played twice successively.
							Default: true.
