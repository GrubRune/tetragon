	ENCOUNTER ZONE ENTITY DEFINITION FILE
	===========================================================================================
	encounterZoneComponent:
		minLevel				(Optional) The minimum level that the encounter zone can be
								calculated. In other words, if the player's level is less
								than the minimum level, the encounter zone will ignore
								the player's level and use the minimum level.
		maxLevel				The maximum level that the encounter zone can be calculated.
								If left 0, the encounter zone will not max out.
		resets					If set to false the encounter zone will never reset, no matter
								how much time passes. The encounter zone will maintain its
								current state forever.
		matchPCIfBelowMinLevel	If set to true, the encounter zone will match the player's
								level if the player enters the encounter zone below the
								minimum level.
		regardCombatBoundary	By default actors in combat with the player only follow the
								player through load portals that lead to the same encounter
								zone. With this set to false, actors in combat with the player
								will ignore this rule and follow the player into a different
								encounter zone.
