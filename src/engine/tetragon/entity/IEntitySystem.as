	 * The base interface for Entity Systems.
	 * 
	 * <p>An entity system is a class that executes the logic that is applied to entities
	 * through their components. A system contains the dedicated implementation logic
	 * for a specific entity component or for a specific group of entity components
	 * (identified by entity families). Entity systems provide the methods that act
	 * upon entity components which on the other hand don't contain any methods but
	 * only properties.</p>
	 * 
	 * <p>Each System runs continuously after it is started (as though each System had itâ€™s own
	 * private thread) and performs global actions on every Entity that possesses a Component
	 * of the same aspect as that System.</p>
	 * 
	 * <p>Typical Entity Systems in a game would be: Rendering System, Animation System, Input
	 * System, etc.</p>
