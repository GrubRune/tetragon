Tetragon : Universal Game Engine for multi-platform ActionScript projects.

Tetragon is an Open Source cross-platform game engine used to develop games and
applications for the web, desktop and mobile devices. It is written purely in
ActionScript 3 and comfortably allows to write source code once and deploy builds
to several different target platforms. Unlike most other Flash-based game engines
and frameworks that allow you to develop a specific type of game or that provide
a subset API to support game development, Tetragon provides a complete foundation
with that any type of game can be developed, incl. resource management, debugging
facilities, multi-locale support, layered extendability, a game-oriented data
structure, and a lot more.
